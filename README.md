# MSc Bioinformatics Project
#### This is a project on analysing scRNA seq data of T-cell receptors in Python.
## Computational approaches to identify immune responses in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and associated antigen targets
#### Raw sequencing data (scRNA seq and TCR-Seq) was collected from immune cells of patients suffering from MASLD. <br /> The main aim of this project was to investigate this data and identify the T-Cell clonotypes involved in triggering immune responses against MASLD. <br /> This repo documents my journey into the usage of python and the various libraries I used for this project. The code/methods I used is documented in the jupyter notebooks and I have attached an image specifying the pipeline I followed:
