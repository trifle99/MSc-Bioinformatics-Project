# MSc Bioinformatics Project
#### This is a project on analysing scRNA seq data of T-cell receptors in Python.
#### Raw sequencing data (scRNA seq and TCR-Seq) was collected from immune cells of patients suffering from MASLD. <br /> The main aim of this project was to investigate this data and identify the T-Cell clonotypes involved in triggering immune responses against MASLD. <br /> I read through many different research articles in single cell and adaptive immune receptor analysis, but one book and it's research article[1] proved very helpful where I used it as my foundation for this project. This repo documents the usage of python and the various [packages](https://github.com/trifle99/MSc-Bioinformatics-Project/blob/main/package%20version.txt/) used during this project. The code/methods I used is documented in the jupyter notebooks and I have attached an image specifying the pipeline I followed: <br /> ![Alt text](/images/methods.png?raw=true "workflow")
