# MSc Bioinformatics Project
# Computational approaches to identify immune responses in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and associated antigen targets
#### Raw sequencing data (scRNA seq and TCR-Seq) was collected from immune cells of patients suffering from MASLD. <br /> The main aim of this project was to investigate this data and identify the T-Cell clonotypes involved in triggering immune responses against MASLD.
